# 👋 Hello, I'm Mesut Suhan Şişman

# About Me!
As a mechanical engineer with five years of experience, I had thought I had found my calling in life. However, as time went on, I began to realize that this was not the case. While I enjoyed the work, I felt unfulfilled and knew that it was not my dream job.

I am 32 years old and have always considered myself to be an open-minded person with an interrogator personality. I believe in the future of the world and my own potential to make a difference. It was this belief that led me to explore other career options and, eventually, to become a Python developer.

Although I had no prior experience in this field, I was determined to learn and to make the most of this new opportunity. I have been working hard to become a data scientist and to learn more about Machine Learning and AI. I believe that these are fields that will play an increasingly important role in the future of technology and in shaping the world we live in.

As I continue to pursue my goals, I am eager to learn, to grow, and to contribute to the world in meaningful ways. I am excited about the future and all of the possibilities that lie ahead, and I look forward to making the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
